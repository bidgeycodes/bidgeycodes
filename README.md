### ✨よろしくね！ I'm bidgey. I'm a data engineer by day, creator of silly unfinished web apps by night. My first year as an engineer has enriched my life in so many ways. I live for creating, learning new things, meeting new folks in the tech ecosystem, and collecting new things to add to my arsenal of tech skills. I am proficient in Java, frontend web dev, and relational databases. Currently I am in the midst of learning C#/.NET, API development and migration, and everything Azure/DevOps. Enjoyer of linguistics, Japanese, urbex, nostalgia, art, live music & astrology.
### <p align="center">I also enjoy helping helping folks new to tech and seeking their first tech role. Our discord is <a href="https://discord.gg/6wVBy9uupt">here</a>.</p>
